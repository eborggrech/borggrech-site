**Work redesign for the AI era.**

I built a software/services company into a product business.  
I care about the practical details: clear ownership, sound governance, and productivity that still respects people.  
This site is a small home for writing and conversations with serious builders.

## In brief

- Built and scaled a software/services company that evolved into a product business
- Started as a developer, then owned the full loop: delivery, sales, hiring, and leadership
- Writing about how people and organizations adapt as AI changes the shape of work

## Short bio

I’m a builder-operator. I started as a developer, then grew into delivery, sales, hiring, and leadership while building a software/services firm that became a product business. Today I’m focused on how organizations adapt as AI changes the shape of work: redefining roles, decision rights, governance, and the skills people need to stay effective. I’m drawn to the intersection of technology and human systems. I prefer clear writing, small experiments, and teams that keep a high bar without losing empathy.

## What I’m focused on

- Turning AI capability into reliable workflows 
- Accountability and decision rights: who owns outcomes, and what “done” means
- Governance for AI-assisted work: quality bars, review loops, and auditability
- Role and skill design: what to train, what to hire, what to automate
- Turning services insight into product (without drifting into custom work)
- Calm execution: fewer meetings, better writing, tighter feedback loops
- Comparing notes and collaborating with founders/operators who value substance

## How I work

- Start with a written problem statement, constraints, and the real decision to be made
- Prefer small, reversible experiments over big reorganizations
- Make ownership explicit (one accountable owner per outcome)
- Use lightweight artifacts: one-pagers, checklists, decision logs, and review cadences
- Communicate plainly, follow through, and keep the bar high without theatrics

## Now

- Prototyping AI-assisted operating routines (planning, reporting, customer support, internal knowledge)
- Exploring governance patterns that scale: reviews, escalation paths, and audit trails
- Thinking about role design as the “unit of work” changes
- Building a reading list across org design, incentives, and human performance
- Writing drafts that are meant to be useful, not viral

## Principles

- Clarity is kindness.
- Systems beat heroics.
- Dignity is a constraint, not a perk.

## Longer bio

I’ve spent my career on the builder side of the table: shipping software, solving messy delivery problems, and learning (sometimes the hard way) how organizations actually execute. I started as a developer and gradually took on the full loop-product, delivery, sales, hiring, and leadership; while growing a software/services company into a product business. Building with real customers and real constraints trained my instincts: outcomes matter, ambiguity compounds, and the smallest process changes can either unlock momentum or slowly suffocate it.

What I’m most interested in now is the transition we’re all living through as AI changes the shape of work. The tools are moving fast, but most operating models are not. Teams keep the same roles, meetings, and handoffs, then hope automation will compensate for unclear ownership or fuzzy standards. It won’t. The opportunities (and risks) sit in the interface between people and systems: decision rights, accountability, governance, and how we design work so quality holds when the pace increases.

My default stance is pragmatic: start with the job to be done, write down what “good” looks like, and redesign the workflow before you scale the tooling. I care about productivity, but I also care about human dignity as a design constraint: people should understand what they’re accountable for, have the agency to do it, and feel respected while doing hard work.

I write to think in public and to find the right peers: founders, operators, and executives who want clear language and honest tradeoffs. If that’s you: whether you’re building, investing, or exploring how to modernize an organization, I’m always open to a thoughtful conversation.
