description: "AI raises the value of judgment: problem framing, verification, tradeoffs, and knowing what not to do."

## Outline

- AI makes output cheap; judgment becomes the scarce asset
- Look for problem framing, not just execution speed
- Test verification habits: can they catch confident mistakes?
- Evaluate tradeoff thinking: risk, cost, time, and second-order effects
- Hire for learning loops and written clarity
- Example: an interview exercise that reveals judgment quickly

## When output is cheap, the differentiator is decision quality

AI can draft code, emails, and analysis. That doesn’t mean roles disappear. It means the skills shift.

The most valuable people will be those who can:

- frame problems clearly
- choose the right level of rigor
- verify claims and sources
- make tradeoffs without hand-waving
- communicate decisions in writing

In other words: judgment.

If you keep hiring as if output volume is the primary skill, you’ll get people who can generate a lot—without reliably moving outcomes forward.

## Problem framing is the first test of judgment

Strong operators don’t start with solutions. They start with a crisp frame:

- What are we trying to achieve?
- What constraints matter?
- What does success look like?
- What’s the smallest useful step?

In interviews, many candidates jump to execution. They want to show competence. They produce answers quickly.

You want to see if they can slow down enough to frame the problem. AI will handle speed. Humans need to handle direction.

A good sign is when someone asks clarifying questions that reveal they’re thinking about outcomes, not just tasks.

## Verification habits matter more than confidence

AI increases the risk of “confident wrong.” The same is true for humans.

You want people who treat claims as checkable. They don’t say “I think.” They say “Here’s how I’d validate.”

In practice, you can test this by giving a candidate an AI-generated answer with subtle errors and asking them to review it.

Do they accept it because it sounds good? Or do they interrogate assumptions, ask for sources, and propose verification steps?

This is not about being skeptical for its own sake. It’s about building systems that don’t collapse under speed.

## Tradeoff thinking is what separates operators from technicians

In real work, you rarely get to optimize one variable.

You trade speed for quality, cost for reliability, simplicity for flexibility. People with strong judgment can articulate tradeoffs explicitly.

They can say: “If we choose A, we gain speed but risk drift. If we choose B, we slow down but get auditability. Given our constraints, I recommend…”

This is especially important when AI proposes multiple options. AI can list tradeoffs. But it can’t own the choice. You need people who can.

In interviews, ask for past examples: “Tell me about a time you chose the ‘worse’ option and why.” The answer reveals maturity.

## Learning loops and written clarity are force multipliers

In the AI era, tools change quickly. The people who thrive are those who learn continuously without drama.

Look for:

- comfort with feedback
- ability to update beliefs
- habit of writing things down
- ability to teach others and share patterns

Written clarity is not just communication. It’s thinking. People who write well tend to think more clearly about constraints and outcomes.

That’s why writing-first teams scale better. And it’s why your hiring should value writing.

## Concrete example: an interview exercise for judgment

A simple exercise:

Give the candidate a short scenario: “A customer reports an issue. We have logs, some vague error messages, and a partial reproduction.”

Provide an AI-drafted response plan that includes a few subtle problems: an overpromise, a missing verification step, a risky assumption.

Ask the candidate to:

- critique the plan
- propose a revised plan
- identify what they would verify first
- state what they would tell the customer and what they would not

This reveals judgment quickly. Great candidates will:

- ask for missing context
- identify risk boundaries
- propose verification steps
- communicate with calm precision

Average candidates will focus on sounding smart.

## A simple checklist

- Are we hiring for judgment, or for output volume?
- Do candidates frame problems before solving them?
- Can they verify claims and catch confident mistakes?
- Do they articulate tradeoffs with real constraints?
- Can they write clearly and reason in public?
- Do they show learning loops: feedback → adjustment → improved approach?
