## Outline

- Task assignment breaks when tasks become cheap and abundant
- Work design means shaping the workflow: inputs, outputs, owners, review
- Define “units of work” and acceptance criteria
- Reduce handoff tax with better interfaces (writing, templates, checklists)
- Build feedback loops that improve the system over time
- Example: turning a chaotic request stream into a stable workflow

## Task assignment assumes scarcity of execution

Traditional management often looks like task assignment: break down work, distribute tasks, track completion.

That model assumes execution is the scarce resource.

AI changes that. Execution becomes cheaper in many domains. The scarce resource becomes clarity: what to do, in what order, with what standards, under what constraints.

If managers keep focusing on assignment, they’ll create busy teams that produce a lot without moving outcomes.

The new management skill is designing how work flows through the system.

## Work design: inputs, outputs, owners, review

Work design is not a grand reorg. It’s operational architecture.

For a given workflow, a manager should be able to answer:

- What triggers the work (inputs)?
- What is the expected output?
- Who is accountable for the outcome?
- What standards define “good”?
- What review happens, and when?
- What happens when we’re unsure?

These questions sound simple. They are often missing.

When they’re missing, teams compensate with meetings, interruptions, and heroics. AI may speed up drafts, but the system remains chaotic.

Design the system and the team becomes calmer and faster.

## Define the unit of work and acceptance criteria

A workflow without a clear unit becomes noisy.

For example, “handle customer requests” is not a unit. “Resolve customer issue with documented outcome and next step” is.

Once the unit is clear, define acceptance criteria: correctness, completeness, risk boundaries, and traceability where needed.

AI can help produce drafts that meet criteria, but only if the criteria exist.

This is where managers add leverage: making standards explicit so the team can operate with autonomy.

## Reduce handoff tax with better interfaces

Most organizational waste lives in handoffs.

One person does work, another inherits it without context, and time is lost reconstructing intent.

Work design reduces handoff tax by improving interfaces:

- one-pagers for decisions
- templates for repeated outputs
- checklists for quality-critical steps
- clear ownership fields (“who owns next?”)

AI helps by accelerating these artifacts. But the manager’s job is to standardize them and make them normal.

A team with good interfaces can scale without increasing meeting load.

## Build feedback loops that improve the system

Good work design includes learning.

If the workflow produces repeated errors, the fix shouldn’t be “try harder.” It should be: update the checklist, clarify the criteria, improve the template, or adjust decision rights.

Managers who build feedback loops create compounding improvements.

This also keeps morale high. Competent people hate repeating preventable mistakes. When the system improves, people feel respected.

AI can accelerate learning by summarizing patterns: common failure modes, frequent exceptions, recurring customer pain points. Use that signal to update the system.

## Concrete example: stabilizing a chaotic request stream

Imagine an internal team flooded with requests: “Can you pull this report?” “Can you fix this config?” “Can you help with onboarding?”

They respond reactively. Work is constantly interrupted. Nothing feels finished.

A manager redesigns the workflow:

- All requests enter through a single intake form.
- Each request must state desired outcome and deadline.
- Requests are triaged weekly into categories with clear owners.
- The unit of work becomes “request resolved with outcome + notes.”
- High-risk requests require review; low-risk are handled quickly.
- Recurring requests become templates or self-serve docs.

Within weeks, interruptions drop. Predictability increases. The team ships fewer things—but delivers more outcomes.

This is management as work design.

## A simple checklist

- Are we managing by assigning tasks, or by designing workflows?
- Do we have a clear unit of work for each recurring workflow?
- Are acceptance criteria explicit and shared?
- Are handoffs structured with templates, checklists, and written context?
- Do we have feedback loops to improve the system over time?
- Where are meetings compensating for missing design?
