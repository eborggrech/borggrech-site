description: "Short essays on AI-era work design: accountability, governance, and practical execution."
---

I write short essays and working notes on building and operating through the AI transition. The thread is practical: redesigning work, keeping accountability intact, and building governance that scales without bureaucratic drag. Expect clear language, real examples, and the occasional template.

## Themes I tend to return to

- Work redesign (roles, workflows, handoffs)
- Accountability and decision rights
- Governance for AI-assisted operations (quality, risk, auditability)
- Productivity with human dignity
- Leadership, incentives, and culture
- Hiring, training, and skill systems
- Services → product lessons
- Writing as an operating tool
- Decision-making under uncertainty
