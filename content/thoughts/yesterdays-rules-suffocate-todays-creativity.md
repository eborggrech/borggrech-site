## Outline
 
- The core problem or tension you’re addressing (grounded in reality)
- Why this problem keeps showing up (systemic, not personal)
- The common but flawed response most teams default to
- The better framing or operating principle
- What changes when this principle is applied
- Example: a concrete, real-world scenario
 
## Open with the real problem
 
You feel it in the room.
A good idea appears, and before it takes its first breath, the process kills it.
 
Someone says: “We can’t do that because we don’t do it that way.”
No one is trying to be difficult.
They’re protecting the system that used to keep things safe.
 
## Why this keeps happening
 
Processes are often created after pain.
A failure happens, so a rule is born.
 
The problem is that the world changes faster than the process.
So teams keep enforcing constraints that no longer match reality.
 
This keeps happening when:
- incentives reward compliance over outcomes
- people are punished for risk but not for stagnation
- decision rights are unclear, so process becomes a shield
 
## The tempting but wrong response
 
The tempting response is to declare war on process.
“Move fast. No red tape.”
 
That often creates chaos.
Chaos forces control.
And control eventually becomes process again.
 
The other tempting response is to accept the process and work around it quietly.
That creates cynicism and slow decay.
 
## A better way to think about it
 
Treat process as a *design choice* that must earn its keep.
 
A better framing:
- Keep the process that protects customers and quality.
- Remove the process that protects egos and habits.
- Create small “edge loops” where experimentation is allowed.
 
Creativity needs constraints.
It just needs the right ones: clarity, ownership, and fast feedback.
 
## What changes when you apply this
 
When you de-calcify process:
- teams propose ideas because they believe action is possible
- learning speed increases (small experiments, short cycles)
- ownership becomes real because decisions are explicit
- risk becomes manageable because experiments are bounded
 
Small companies win by learning faster than big companies can approve.
 
## Concrete example
 
A team wanted to try a new onboarding flow.
The old process required 6 approvals and a quarterly roadmap slot.
 
They introduced an edge loop:
- experiment budget: 2 weeks
- customer impact boundary: only new signups
- success metric: activation rate
- DRI empowered to decide
 
They shipped a small version, measured results, and either scaled or killed it.
No heroics. No theatre. Just learning.
 
## A simple checklist / rule of thumb
 
### A simple checklist
- What pain did this process originally solve?
- Does that pain still exist at the same level?
- Who benefits from keeping the process (customers, team, or bureaucracy)?
- Can we create a bounded experiment instead of a full change request?
- Who is the DRI who can say yes?
 
### Rule of thumb
If a process can’t explain the customer it protects, it’s probably protecting the past.
