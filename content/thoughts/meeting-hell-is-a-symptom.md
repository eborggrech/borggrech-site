## Outline
 
- The core problem or tension you’re addressing (grounded in reality)
- Why this problem keeps showing up (systemic, not personal)
- The common but flawed response most teams default to
- The better framing or operating principle
- What changes when this principle is applied
- Example: a concrete, real-world scenario
 
## Open with the real problem
 
You open your calendar and it feels like a hostile takeover.
Recurring meetings have multiplied, and somehow you still don’t feel aligned.
 
People leave calls with action items, then schedule another call to “make sure it happens.”
The work slows down, but the talking speeds up.
 
## Why this keeps happening
 
Meetings rarely multiply because people love meetings.
They multiply because the system is missing something:
- decisions are not recorded
- ownership is unclear
- “done” is not defined
- there’s no single source of truth
 
When work is not legible, the only way to coordinate is to talk.
So the org becomes a chat room with a payroll.
 
## The tempting but wrong response
 
The common response is to add “better meetings.”
Agendas, tighter facilitation, more discipline.
 
That helps a bit, but it misses the point.
Meetings are an expensive workaround for missing artifacts.
 
Another flawed response is to declare “async only” without building the written system.
That just creates confusion in a different format.
 
## A better way to think about it
 
Treat meetings as a last-mile tool, not the main operating system.
 
A simple principle:
**If a meeting does not produce an artifact that changes future behavior, it’s mostly theatre.**
 
Replace “alignment” with artifacts:
- Decision log (what we decided and why)
- Owner map (who owns what)
- Work brief (what we’re doing and what done means)
- Weekly plan (top outcomes and risks)
 
Then keep meetings only for:
- high-stakes disagreements
- fast synthesis when writing would be slower
- sensitive topics where nuance matters
 
## What changes when you apply this
 
When artifacts exist:
- fewer people need to attend
- fewer meetings are needed to “remember”
- decisions stick because they’re recorded
- newcomers can catch up without draining the room
 
The calendar becomes a tool again, not a symptom.
 
## Concrete example
 
A product team had three recurring meetings: backlog grooming, roadmap alignment, stakeholder sync.
 
They introduced two artifacts:
- a one-page Work Brief for each initiative
- a Decision Log updated weekly
 
Result:
- stakeholder sync became a written update + optional Q&A
- roadmap alignment became asynchronous comments on briefs
- only disagreements triggered a meeting
 
They didn’t “fix meetings.”
They made meetings unnecessary.
 
## A simple checklist / rule of thumb
 
### A simple checklist
- What artifact will exist after this meeting that didn’t exist before?
- Who is the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI), and what decision are they empowered to make?
- What would make this meeting obsolete next month?
- Can the first 80% be done in writing?
- Are we meeting because we don’t trust the system?
 
### Rule of thumb
If a recurring meeting has no artifact output, it’s a process bug.
