## Outline

- Templates reduce cognitive load and increase consistency
- Standard work is how you scale quality without micromanaging
- Templates should encode decision rights, criteria, and ownership
- AI makes templates more powerful (drafting + adaptation), not less necessary
- Keep templates lightweight and alive (review and iterate)
- Example: a decision template that improves execution across teams

## Templates are a way to package judgment

People often resist templates because they fear rigidity.

But good templates don’t remove thinking. They remove repeated framing work so thinking can focus on the hard parts.

In a growing organization, inconsistency is expensive. Different people reinvent the same docs, decisions, and processes. Quality varies. Handoffs break.

Templates create a shared interface. They encode what matters. They reduce the chance that critical context is omitted.

This is strategy because it shapes how the organization behaves at scale.

## Standard work scales quality without adding managers

Standard work sounds industrial. In knowledge work, it’s often the difference between a stable system and perpetual chaos.

When you have standard work:

- new hires ramp faster
- errors become easier to detect
- outcomes become more consistent
- review becomes lighter because expectations are clear

Without it, quality depends on who is involved. That’s fragile.

AI increases output speed, which increases the need for stable standards. Templates are one of the cheapest ways to provide that stability.

## Templates should encode ownership and decision rights

The most valuable templates do more than provide structure. They encode governance.

A good decision template includes:

- the decision to be made
- the decider
- the owner of execution
- the review date
- constraints and non-negotiables
- what would change the decision

A good incident template includes:

- what happened
- customer impact
- owner
- root cause
- preventive change
- follow-up date

When templates encode ownership, work stops floating. It lands.

This reduces politics and increases speed because authority is clear.

## AI makes templates more powerful, not obsolete

Some assume AI makes templates unnecessary because you can “just ask the model.”

That misses the point.

If your template encodes your organization’s standards, the AI can draft within those standards. If you have no template, the AI will draft within generic internet patterns.

Templates give AI constraints, tone, and completeness.

You can also use AI to improve templates: identify missing fields, propose clearer language, detect recurring omissions, and generate examples.

The organization becomes more consistent because both humans and tools operate within the same structure.

## Keep templates alive: small review, regular iteration

Templates fail when they become stale.

If people treat templates as “compliance,” they’ll fill them out mechanically or bypass them. If they treat templates as tools, they’ll improve them.

A simple practice:

- review templates quarterly
- ask: what fields are ignored? what fields are missing?
- update based on real failure modes and new needs

Template evolution is how you keep standard work aligned with reality.

A dead template is worse than no template. A living template is a compounding asset.

## Concrete example: a decision template that improves execution

Imagine cross-team decisions constantly reappear: prioritization, process changes, customer commitments.

You introduce a decision template:

- Context (what’s happening, why now)
- Decision (the choice)
- Options (2–3 paths)
- Recommendation (with tradeoffs)
- Decider + date
- Owner + next actions
- Risks + mitigation
- Review date

Within weeks, debates improve. People stop arguing over missing context. Execution improves because owners and next steps are explicit. Decisions stick because they’re recorded and reviewed.

This template becomes a quiet backbone. It scales management without creating more management.

## A simple checklist

- Where are we reinventing the same artifacts repeatedly?
- Which missing fields cause the most mistakes (owner, criteria, risks)?
- Can we encode decision rights and ownership into templates?
- Do templates make work easier—or feel like compliance?
- Do we review and update templates based on real failure modes?
- Are AI tools drafting within our templates and standards?
